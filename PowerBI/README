This folder contains all of our PowerBI Reports. 

The Metrics Dashboards folder holds PowerBI reports on each of the respective categories we divided the project up into (Census, Income, Crime, etc). 
Each dashboard in this folder will host any visualizations we've created and will contain all of the datasets we could find on the respective categories, 
in relation to the City of Grand-Rapids. 

Data from each report can be accessed by downloading the PowerBI report and opening it on your own PowerBI instance.
