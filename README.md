# City_Of_GrandRapids_Social_Impact

This GitHub repository was made for the City of Grand Rapids Social Impact Project

This project, centered around the City of Grand Rapids, MI, is designed around using
a combination of all available data sources to build an interactive reporting tool
for the purposes of understanding social impacts, improving public safety, and
providing a good measure of effect of governmental policy on Grand Rapids.
