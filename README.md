# City_Of_GrandRapids_Social_Impact

This GitHub repository was made for the City of Grand Rapids Social Impact Project

This project, centered around the City of Grand Rapids, MI, is designed around using
a combination of all available data sources to build an interactive reporting tool
for the purposes of understanding social impacts, improving public safety, and
providing a good measure of effect of governmental policy on Grand Rapids.

The repository hosts all of our visualizations/dashboards, as well as any code we may have used in order to clean our data

Within the repository, we have everything (outside of data) somebody may need to run through our full project,
including instructions for installing all the proper software, our final product PowerBI dashboards,
and instructions regarding reproducibility of the whole project.

The datasets will contain information in relation to, but are not limited to:

- Health and Wellness
